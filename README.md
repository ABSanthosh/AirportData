# Airport Data

This is a partial list of airport data of the following format:

```json
{
    "city": "Abidjan",
    "id": "13047",
    "airport": "Felix Houphouet Boigny",
    "iata": "ABJ",
    "country": "Cote d'Ivoire",
    "countrycode": "CI",
    "state": "",
    "other1": "",
    "other2": "",
    "other3": "",
    "other4": "",
    "tag": "",
    "time_zone": "Africa/Abidjan"
},
```

The source I used in `raw-flight-data.sh` is pretty reliable but not comprehensive. Perhaps it is but only for connections to and from India and nothing more.

If you have better source, make an issue and I'll update the scraper.
